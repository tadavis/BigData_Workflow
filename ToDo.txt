To do:
1. Figure out how to write the memory-mapped ff file into my project workspace with a 
sensible name.
2. Figure out how to use the pre-written ff file in an analysis, without having to 
   reread from the PostgreSQL database and recreate the file.
3. It looks like I can use either biglm (from biglm) or bigglm.ffdf(from ffbase) to 
   regress on an ffdf object.  Should find out if I got lucky, or if this is always
   the case.
4. How do I do the regression analysis across multiple cores with an ffdf object?

5. Do this on-database?
